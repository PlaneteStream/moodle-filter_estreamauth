 The Planet eStream Authentication Plugin will automatically authenticate users viewing embedded Planet eStream quizzes within Moodle. With the plugin installed, you will no longer have to log in each time you wish to take a quiz, as long as your Moodle user name matches a user name within your Planet eStream Installation.
